=======================迭代优化
>>> squares = []
>>> for x in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:          # This is what a list comprehension does        
        squares.append(x ** 2)         # Both run the iteration protocol internally
>>> squares
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

Both tools leverage the iteration protocol internally and produce the same result.
The list comprehension, though, and related functional programming tools like map
and filter, will often run faster than a for loop today on some types of code
(perhaps even twice as fast)—a property that could matter in your programs for large
data sets. Having said that, though, I should point out that performance measures
are tricky business in Python because it optimizes so much, and they may vary from
release to release.
